           <p class="text-justify">A Basic Definition. Essentially, a freelance job is one where a person works for themselves, rather than for a company. While freelancers do take on contract work for companies and organizations, they are ultimately self-employed.</p>
           <p class="text-justify">What is freelance work? Freelance work is a type of self-employment that is carried out on a flexible basis, and provided to a variety of different businesses. Freelancers could work on big or small projects, both short-term and long-term â€“ depending on what suits their skills, availability, and the employer's needs.</p>
